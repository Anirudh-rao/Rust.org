# Flow of Control

An integral part of any programming language are ways to modify control flow: if/else, for, and others. Let's talk about them in Rust. We wil cover topics like:

1. If/Else
2. loop
3. while
4. For And Range
5. Match
6. if let
7. let-else
8. while- let


## if/else
Branching with if-else is similar to other languages. Unlike many of them, the boolean condition doesn't need to be surrounded by parentheses, and each condition is followed by a block. if-else conditionals are expressions, and, all branches must return the same type.
