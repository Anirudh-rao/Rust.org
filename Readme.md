# Getting Started with Rust
Rust is an open-source systems programming language that is syntactically similar to C++.

It is a general purpose programming language that is extensively used to build:

1. kernels for operating systems
2. game engines for video games
3. browser engines for web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, etc.
command-line tools, and so on.

Features of Rust Programming
Here're some of the major features of Rust that make it one of the most popular programming languages in recent times.

1. Performance

Just like C programming, Rust is fast and requires less memory. So, we are not compromising on performance with Rust.

2. Memory Safety

Rust prevents the crashing of programs by ensuring memory safety. Without memory safety, programs can crash unexpectedly.

3. Safe Concurrency

Rust allows multiple parts of the program to run simultaneously. However, they cannot modify the same value at the same time. This ensures different parts of the program can safely run concurrently.

4. Platform Independent

You can compile a Rust program on one platform, then take it to another platform and run it. Rust supports a large number of platforms/operating systems.
